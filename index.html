            	The changing landscape of India's roads. </br></br></br></br>
            	India's rapidly growing middle class has resulted in <a href = "http://www.uctc.net/research/UCTC-DISS-2012-01.pdf" target="_blank">an explosion in vehicle ownership</a> and more cars competing for space on the roads. This, paired with India's notoriously <a href = "http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/marianne.bertrand/research/papers/corruption_driving_india_qje.pdf" target="_blank">corrupt driver's licensing system</a>, has made India one of the most dangerous countries to take to the roads. </br></br>

            	<i>“Neither the rich and powerful nor the poor can escape the fury of our killer roads.”</i></br> - <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Politics/VzvthE7UmNIF8Wlh6s5kUO/Death-every-five-minutes-as-Indias-roads-become-most-danger.html" target="_blank">Anumita Roychowdhury</a></br>Executive Director at the Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi

                <p class="context3"><b>What are some key takeaways from this map?</b></br>
                Overall, traffic-related injuries grew between 2003 and 2011. Goa, a popular tourist spot, consistently had the most injuries each year. Lakshadweep, an archipelago off the western coast, consistently has the fewest injuries; they reported zero traffic injuries for 2011. 

            </p>
            <p class="context1"><b>Where did I dig up this data?</b></br>
                My primary data source was india's snazzy <a href="https://data.gov.in/" target="_blank">Open Government Data Platform</a>. This dataset was collected by the Transport Research Wing of the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. They are obtained by police departments of the States and Union Territories in India, so we at at their mercy in terms of how accurate this data is. 
               </br></br>
      			There was a bit of data manipulation involved. Most states saw an increase in population, which would naturally increase the raw total of accident injuries. Using <a href = "http://censusindia.gov.in/" target="_blank">Indian census data</a> from 2001 and 2011, I modeled the population growth linearly and normalized the raw totals. Save for the error in using a linear growth model (population tends to grow more geometrically), these totals reflect the approximate number of injuries per 100,000 people per year.
            </p>
                <p class="context2"><b>Why did I make this map?</b></br>
      			I spent the summer of 2013 in India, and most of my initial culture shock came from the fact that Indian traffic does not follow most "rules of the road" that we are used to. Instead they depend mostly on instinct and an intricate system horn-honking and yelling. Most of the time, it works out just fine; however, it's easy to see why India is one of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/india" target="_blank">most dangerous</a> places to drive.
               </br></br>
                My first time in Indian traffic was about as thrilling as riding a brand-new roller coaster and about as anxiety-inducing as if that roller coaster may or may not collide with a bus 10 times its size at any moment. All drivers vie for another inch of space and snatch it as soon as it opens. At stop lights, vehicles pack so tightly together that you might be able to smell the cologne of the person on the rickshaw next to you (if the smells of exhaust and gasoline weren’t stronger, that is). 
               </br></br>
                After learning about what contributed to the spectacle of Indian traffic, I was interested in how this has changed over time as more and more people purchase vehicles.
